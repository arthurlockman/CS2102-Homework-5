1. To accomplish this goal, we created the IReportList interface, which is a container for all types of weather reports.
   We then implemented this interface in WeatherReportList, where the weather data is actually stored and manipulated.
   In the implementation in WeatherMonitor, the user only has access to the IReportList and not to the underlying
   LinkedList data structure, thereby protecting the underlying data.

   To change from using a LinkedList to a weatherGlob, all one would have to do would be to implement IReportList using
   the weatherGlob storage structure instead of the LinkedList that we use in WeatherReportList. No existing files would
   have to be changed to accomplish this; one would simply have to create a new class that implements IReportList and
   fill in the methods to properly interact with the weatherGlob. One would also have to change line 5 of WeatherMonitor
   to private IReportList reports = new WeatherGlobReportList() instead of
   private IReportList reports = new WeatherReportList().
